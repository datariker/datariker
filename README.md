 <h3 align="center"><strong>Fandoms + Interests</strong></h3>
   <TABLE BORDER>
    <tr>
      <td><p>I love coding, technology, writing, reading, exploring nature, and music!</p>
      <p>My favorite music is metal, disco, old pop, electronic, synthwave (if you give me a song with any kind of synth in it, I'll probably like it. Recs encouraged!), j-pop, and rock.</p>
      <p>Some games I play are Pony Town (obvs), Blue Archive (only on mobile, get that anti-cheat off my computer), and Star Trek online.</p>
      <p>Main fandoms I'm in are Star Trek, Transformers, Blue Archive, Star Wars, and Hazbin Hotel</p></td>

<!--Section 4-->
 <h3 align="center"><strong>Extra/BYI!</strong></h3>
  <TABLE BORDER>
    <tr>
      <td><p>I'm anticensorship & antiharassment. I'm pro-science, pro-ship, and pro-privacy. (Ik these sound silly but it's just my way of saying most of my view points are based on empirical evidence & I think        everyone deserves privacy, esp on the internet.)</p>
      <p>I like most ships. You can probably convince me to ship anything atp ðŸ˜¸</p>
      <p>I don't like drama that much and I probably won't say anything about it unless I'm directly involved. Gossip just isn't my thing.</p>
      <p>I like roleplaying, AUs, fanfiction, fanart, (though I am horrible at drawing), and all the classic fandom-y things! Fandoms are built for fun! Keep weirdos in them!</p>
      <p>Sometimes I can be a little awkward/quiet, so I apologize in advance. I might take a minute to warm up because I feel super awkward/don't know what to say. All I take to warm up is some kindness and            patience.</p></td>
